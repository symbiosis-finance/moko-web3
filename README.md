## Requirements
- Gradle version 6.8+
- Android API 16+
- iOS version 11.0+

## Installation
root build.gradle  
```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/symbiosis-finance/maven")
        credentials {
            username = System.getenv("GITHUB_USERNAME")
            password = System.getenv("TOKEN")
        }
    }
}
```

project build.gradle
```groovy
dependencies {
    commonMainApi("dev.icerock.moko:web3:1.0.1")
}
```

## Getting started

To start with, you should create `Web3Executor` instance.

```kotlin
val web3 = Web3("rpc url")
```

Now you can connect to the blockchain using this library. 

For example, a web3 call:

```kotlin
val balance = web3.getNativeBalance(WalletAddress("..."))
```

moko-web3 also supports **batching**:

```kotlin
val (firstBalance, secondBalance) = 
    web3.executeBatch(
        Web3Requests.getNativeBalance(WalletAddress("...")),
        Web3Requests.getNativeBalance(WalletAddress("..."))
    )
```

This will be retrieved in one HTTP request.

If you want to call a smart contract method, see an example [here](web3/src/commonMain/kotlin/dev.icerock.moko.web3/contract/param/README.md)

## Contributing
All development (both new features and bug fixes) is performed in `develop` branch. This way `master` sources always contain sources of the most recently released version. Please send PRs with bug fixes to `develop` branch. Fixes to documentation in markdown files are an exception to this rule. They are updated directly in `master`.

The `develop` branch is pushed to `master` during release.

More detailed guide for contributors see in [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
